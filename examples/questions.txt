- When do we have to synchronize if there is no mem copy?
- Do we need to call processDataAfter only when we want to synchronize?
    -processDataAfter free device pointers and before doing that synchronizes the device.
    -We need to synchronize when the DynRefCount=0, however, because processDataAfter is not called the
     DynRefCount of the pragma instructions inside a pragma data map is never decremented...
    -So we can call the processDataAfter only to decrement the DynRefCount, and only when it is 0, we
     synchronize and deallocate variables, for the other cases, the information required to deallocate device
     pointers and synchronize has to be saved somehow
