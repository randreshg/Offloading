-The nowait clause generates and adds to the queue an openmp task with a call to __tgt_target_nowait_mapper. 
-omp target data maps variables to a device data environment, and defines the lexical scope of the data environment 
 that is created. The variables mapped are copied back to the device when the scope finishes.


-Between kernel invokes when there is no clause specified, we have to synchronize.
-We can overlap host and device operations.
->
We can create a queue of tasks, and each time we need to synchronize with the host, we will execute all kernels.








What we have to do is
the device only when deallocating memory in the device.
