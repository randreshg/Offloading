- Do we need to synchronize when copying the memory back to the device or when deallocating memory?

- If the code finishes execution but the device offloading is not ready yet?
Should we make sure there is an implicit omp task wait before the program finishes?

Example code
int main () {
    int a=100;
    //NO MEMORY COPY FROM DEVICE
    #pragma omp target nowait
    {
        a = a + 1;
        printf("Result1 %d \n", a);
    }
    printf("Result %d \n", a);
    //#pragma omp taskwait
    return 0;
}

- If there is a print statement inside a target region, if we decide to execute that asyncronously.
